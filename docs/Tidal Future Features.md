## Potential Future features

### Cross-chain opportunities

The DeFi ecosystem has many opportunities within it, however many are blocked by being on different chains which can pose an issue to many users. Bridging is not an easy process for those who haven't done it, thereby DeFi becomes limited in what is accessible on the chain they are on.

Expanding the net that Tidal can capture brings more options for the user to invest their money and brings more protocols and projects into the Tidal ecosystem. If there is a good opportunity on Solana, or other networks such as Aptos and Sui, how might we bring this into one place?

And what risk does this pose?

### Different financial products

There are a range of standard DeFi primitives - lending, borrowing, yield farming, LPs - that make up a "core" subset of DeFi products. There are however other areas that may be of interest to users.

Other areas include:

- RWA: tokenised treasuries, real estate and commodities
- NFT finance: fractionalisation and exposure to digital art investments
- Derivatives & Structured products such as perps and options
- Insurance & prediction products
- Synthetic assets such as stock tokens, gold or commodities exposure

Some of these may pose significant risk but others may come into the Tidal ecosystem quite well, giving users more range in potential investments.

## AI-integrated DAO

As well as enabling personalised investments and vaults, Tidal could develop into a more robust and larger protocol that integrates AI agents into the workings on a DAO, thereby combining AI capabilities with human reasoning and decision making.

- Structured and adapting public Tidal vaults: Similar to Yearn vaults but run and managed by AI agents who research and asses risk, offering advice on whether investments should be redeployed or not
- The AI must not take action without the explicit consent of participants in the vault. They can research and suggest actions to take, but can never execute on anything without a vote to do so.
- Quadratic voting - potentially weighted by how much money you have in the vault - is a process where the human participants can work with the AI to make the correct decisions concerning the vaults investment
- Humans should also be able to suggest strategies, with potential rewards or benefits for people who propose successful strategies
